# Screen Capture

It's a Windows desktop application for recording a specific window or a specific part of your screen, and then immediately publishing that video to youtube as an unlisted video.

The plan:

- Use Windows API for recording the screen;
- Create a thin wrapper around Youtube API and use that to set up the video publishing workflow;
- Make a console or a graphical interface for leveraging that functionality.
